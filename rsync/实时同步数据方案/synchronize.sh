#From the rsync manual
#      -K, --keep-dirlinks
#              This  option  causes  the  receiving  side  to treat a symlink to a directory as
#              though it were a real directory, but only if it matches a  real  directory  from
#              the  sender.   Without  this option, the receiverâ€™s symlink would be deleted and
#              replaced with a real directory.
