How to use one module's variable in another module in terraform?

You can use outputs to accomplish this. Such as if there are 2 modules, kafka and cloudwatch.

In your kafka module, you could define an output that looks something like this:

output "instance_ids" {
  value = ["${aws_instance.kafka.*.id}"]
}

Case 1 - If you are calling kafka module from cloudwatch module by instantiated the module with something like:

module "kafka" {
  source = "./modules/kafka"
}

# You can then access that output as follows:
instances = ["${module.kafka.instance_ids}"]

Case 2 - If your modules are isolated from each other (i.e. your cloudwatch module doesn't instantiate your kafka module), you can pass the outputs as variables between modules:

module "kafka" {
  source = "./modules/kafka"
}

module "cloudwatch" {
  source = "./modules/cloudwatch"
  instances = ["${module.kafka.instance_ids}"]
}

# Of course, your "cloudwatch" module would have to declare the instances variable.
